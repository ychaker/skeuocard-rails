# skeuocard-rails

Use [skeuocard](http://kenkeiter.com/skeuocard/) with rails 3.1+ asset pipeline.

## Installation

This gem vendors skeuocard for Rails 3.1 and greater. The files
will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use.

First add the following lines to your applications `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem 'skeuocard-rails'
```

Then run `bundle install` to update your application's bundle.

Now you need to edit your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`
file and add the following:

(NOTE: Various browser hacks in the skeuocard CSS require css_ua.js to function properly. To avoid browser issues, make sure to include it if it is not already included in your project.)

``` javascript
//= require css_ua # Omit if already included elsewhere
//= require skeuocard
```

And then edit your `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` file to
look something like:

``` css
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require skeuocard.reset
 *= require skeuocard
 *= require_tree .
 */
```

## Usage

Simply call the card with javascript after implementing the correct html.

``` javascript
  card = new Skeuocard($("#skeuocard"));
```
